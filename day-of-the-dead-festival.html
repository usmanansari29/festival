			A Brief History of Mexico’s Day of the Dead			
			</h1>

			<p class="para">
			The Day of the Dead is one of Mexico’s most widespread traditions, which is now heavily associated with Catrina skulls, all-night vigils, and Halloween. Although the Día de Muertos celebrations do roughly coincide with the more commercialised (and previously Pagan) Halloween festivities, there are in fact vast differences between the two events, despite their shared ‘Christianization’. Here’s our brief history of Mexico’s Day of the Dead.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			The Day of the Dead is an annual tradition, now celebrated on November 1 and 2 (although preparations can take weeks), in which the living honour the dead, both so as to help them into the afterlife and encourage them to visit the world of the living for one night. November 1—often called Día de los Inocentes or Angelitos—is reserved for honouring deceased children, while the second day is for deceased adults. While the idea of celebrating death might seem a tad morbid in many societies, in Mexico it’s quite the opposite; death is not the end, it’s just a new beginning.

			<p class="para">
			Día de Muertos is popularly celebrated by holding graveside vigils, at which altars honoring the deceased’s life are typically constructed. However, many people also choose to construct more private altars in their homes. These altars (altares) are decorated with the ubiquitous cempasúchil (Mexican marigold) flowers and candles, as well as skull iconography in some shape or form, and ofrendas (offerings) such as the deceased’s personal possessions, favourite drinks or foods—don’t be surprised to see cigarettes, cans of Coke and football shirts on a Day of the Dead altar! These items supposedly convince the deceased to return to the world of the living. Some other common traditions include the eating of pan de muertos, a distinctively shaped sweet bread which is lightly orange flavoured and covered in sugar, the creation of sugar skulls, and painting one’s face to look like that of a Calavera Catrina. (The latter is admittedly much more of a traveler tradition than a local one.)

			The origins of the Día de Muertos are rooted in Mesoamerican culture and possibly Aztec festivals that celebrated the goddess Mictecacihuatl. However, the festivities are now more widespread than they were then. Predominantly native to southern parts of what is now Mexico, the north of the country, due to different indigenous groups and rituals, was in fact only introduced to this tradition within the last two centuries. Either way, due to the arrival and influence of Christianity which sought to annihilate many indigenous rituals, the festivities we see today in all likelihood vary somewhat from the Mesoamerican Día de Muertos celebrations. This is most true when we consider the moving of the festival’s dates; previously celebrated sometime around early August onwards, Christian influence shifted the Día de Muertos to All Hallows’ Eve and All Saint’s Day. Ultimately, the Day of the Dead is now an agglomeration of various different cultures and beliefs.

			Even so, the Day of the Dead holds such cultural significance that in 2008 it was declared a UNESCO event of ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage’, and in the 60s it was introduced to Mexican school curriculums, which led to its designation as a national holiday. If you want to respectfully immerse yourself in the festivities, some of the most typical places to visit during the Day of the Dead period are Michoacán’s Isla de Janitzio or Oaxaca City, where parades, vigils and concerts are held to celebrate the occasion. Outside of Mexico, Europe and the US observe many Mexican Day of the Dead traditions, such as honoring their dead by making offerings and visiting gravesides on All Saint’s Day. Brazil too celebrates Finados (Day of the Dead) on November 2, whereas in Bolivia, a similar day (Día de las Ñatitas) is celebrated on November 9.

			History

				<img src="images/dia de los muretos/mexico-festival4.jpg" width="60%">
			</center>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Day of the Dead originated several thousand years ago with the Aztec, Toltec, and other Nahua people, who considered mourning the dead disrespectful. For these pre-Hispanic cultures, death was a natural phase in life’s long continuum. The dead were still members of the community, kept alive in memory and spirit—and during Día de los Muertos, they temporarily returned to Earth. Today’s Día de los Muertos celebration is a mash-up of pre-Hispanic religious rites and Christian feasts. It takes place on November 1 and 2—All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day on the Catholic calendar—around the time of the fall maize harvest.
			</p>
			<h3>
			Altars
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			The centerpiece of the celebration is an altar, or ofrenda, built in private homes and cemeteries. These aren’t altars for worshipping; rather, they’re meant to welcome spirits back to the realm of the living. As such, they’re loaded with offerings—water to quench thirst after the long journey, food, family photos, and a candle for each dead relative. If one of the spirits is a child, you might find small toys on the altar. Marigolds are the main flowers used to decorate the altar. Scattered from altar to gravesite, marigold petals guide wandering souls back to their place of rest. The smoke from copal incense, made from tree resin, transmits praise and prayers and purifies the area around the altar.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			Literary <i>calaveras</i>
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			<i>Calavera</i> means “skull.” But during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, calavera was used to describe short, humorous poems, which were often sarcastic tombstone epitaphs published in newspapers that poked fun at the living. These literary calaveras eventually became a popular part of Día de los Muertos celebrations. Today the practice is alive and well. You’ll find these clever, biting poems in print, read aloud, and broadcast on television and radio programs.

			The calavera Catrina

			</center>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			In the early 20th century, Mexican political cartoonist and lithographer José Guadalupe Posada created an etching to accompany a literary calavera. Posada dressed his personification of death in fancy French garb and called it Calavera Garbancera, intending it as social commentary on Mexican society’s emulation of European sophistication. “Todos somos calaveras,” a quote commonly attributed to Posada, means “we are all skeletons.” Underneath all our manmade trappings, we are all the same.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			In 1947 artist Diego Rivera featured Posada’s stylized skeleton in his masterpiece mural “Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park.” Posada’s skeletal bust was dressed in a large feminine hat, and Rivera made his female and named her Catrina, slang for “the rich.” Today, the calavera Catrina, or elegant skull, is the Day of the Dead’s most ubiquitous symbol.

			Food of the dead

			<p class="para">
			You work up a mighty hunger and thirst traveling from the spirit world back to the realm of the living. At least that’s the traditional belief in Mexico. Some families place their dead loved one’s favorite meal on the altar. Other common offerings:
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				<i>Pan de muerto,</i> or bread of the dead, is a typical sweet bread (pan dulce), often featuring anise seeds and decorated with bones and skulls made from dough. The bones might be arranged in a circle, as in the circle of life. Tiny dough teardrops symbolize sorrow.

			Costumes
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Day of the Dead is an extremely social holiday that spills into streets and public squares at all hours of the day and night. Dressing up as skeletons is part of the fun. People of all ages have their faces artfully painted to resemble skulls, and, mimicking the calavera Catrina, they don suits and fancy dresses. Many revelers wear shells or other noisemakers to amp up the excitement—and also possibly to rouse the dead and keep them close during the fun.

			You’ve probably seen this beautiful Mexican paper craft plenty of times in stateside Mexican restaurants. The literal translation, pierced paper, perfectly describes how it’s made. Artisans stack colored tissue paper in dozens of layers, then perforate the layers with hammer and chisel points. Papel picado isn’t used exclusively during Day of the Dead, but it plays an important role in the holiday. Draped around altars and in the streets, the art represents the wind and the fragility of life.

			When Is Day of the Dead

			Day of the Dead is celebrated on November 1st and 2nd. It is sometimes confused with Halloween because of the symbolic skulls but is not related at all.

			It is said that on November 1st the children who have passed come back to visit and celebrate as angelitos and on the following day, November 2nd, it’s the adults (Difuntos) turn to show up for the festivities.

			Family members prepare for several weeks in advance for the tradition by creating altars, decorating burial sites, and cooking specific Day of the Dead food.

			Origins of Dia de Muertos
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			When the Spaniards came to Mexico and introduced Catholicism to the indigenous people they blended traditions and beliefs to create their own customs.

			Dia de Muertos came to be from a mixture of the Aztec festival dedicated to the goddess, Mictecacihuatl, with the Catholic influence. Mictecacihuatl is the “lady of the dead” and it is said that she watches over the bones of the dead and swallows the stars during the day.

			The church rejected the Aztec’s beliefs and turned it into All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day making it on 2 days to fall into the catholic calendar. Mexicans have since transformed it into a truly unique holiday that they honor every year.

			How It’s Celebrated Today
			</h1>
			<p class="para">
			Today’s customs regarding Day of the Dead festivities have morphed over the years to become the distinct tradition it is now. Flowers, altars, food, and music are all integral parts of the holiday.

			Families will gather during the night at the cemeteries (panteons), light candles, and place flowers on the burial sites of their lost loved ones. There is festive music and definitely no crying or grieving. This is a reflective and lively get-together honoring the deceased back to celebrate life and enjoy all the human things again.

			<h3>
			Countries That Celebrate Day of the Dead
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Mexico is not the only country that celebrates Day of the Dead. Many other Latin countries like Columbia, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela all have their distinct ways of welcoming back their passed loved ones. Some not as colorful and festive as the Mexican version, but still a spiritual time for families to get together and reflect.

			Traditions and customs vary per country, but the base beliefs remain the same. Even in Mexico, the customs vary depending on the area in Mexico. Day of the Dead tends to be celebrated more elaborately in Central and Southern Mexico.

			All Souls Day is celebrated in parts of Europe but is nowhere near the equivalent of the festive celebrations of Day of the Dead in Mexico.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			How You Can Celebrate Day of the Dead
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			You can celebrate Day of the Dead in the USA respectfully by understanding the customs and honoring the tradition for what it is.

			“There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to celebrate The Day of the Dead in the US. Most Mexicans enjoy the fact that you are interested in their culture and want to get to know their traditions. If you choose to celebrate Day of the Dead, make sure you understand the event and its traditional practices before partaking in the festivities.”

			Day of the Dead in Mexico is no small event. It has been celebrated for centuries and has recently gained popularity outside of Mexico. The holiday is a great way to honor and remember our loved ones who have passed.

			The preparations leading up to the event are important and deeply rooted in Mexican culture. For Mexicans, this is a deeply spiritual and family-bonding experience.

			Once a year we can eat and drink with the ones that are no longer with us. What a great way to commemorate the people we love and miss.
