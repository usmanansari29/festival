		<br>	
		<p class="para">Tsechu in the local language (Dzongkha) literally means the tenth day of the month and is celebrated widely throughout Bhutan in various Dzongs (fortresses) and monasteries. The festival commemorate the deeds of the Great saint Guru Rinpoche in the form of well choreographed masked dances, traditional songs and dances by men and women dressed in colorful costumes.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="para">Tshechus are a rich form of oral history where the Bhutanese pass on values, mythology and spiritual beliefs through the dance dramas. They are grand events where entire communities come together to witness the religious dances, receive blessings and socialise.</p>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/TSECHUS/tshechu-festival2.jpeg" width="60%"></center><br>
		<p class="para">According to legend, the concept of Tsechu was instituted to Bhutan by Guru Padmasambhava, the great Nyingmapa scholar when he first visited Bhutan and Tibet in the 8th and 9th Century. Padmasambhava performed a series of dance of subjugation to conquer local deities and gods to restore the king’s health and in return the King agreed to spread Buddhism in Bhutan
		</p>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/TSECHUS/tshechus-festival3.jpg"	width="60%"></center>
		<br>	
		<p class="para">Myth has it that Guru Padmasambhava manifested himself in eight different human forms and danced in front of a fearful demon that was hiding from Padmasambhava.  These became the Chams (dances) depicting glory of Padmasambhava after the fearful demon was transformed into a protector of Buddhism.</p>
		<br>	
		<center><img src="images/TSECHUS/tshechu-festival4.jpg" width="60%"></center><br>
		<p class="para">But the tshechu is more than a celebration of Guru Rinpoche’s extraordinary life and contributions. It is a moment to give thanks; it is a time for the people to supplicate for better days ahead.</p>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/TSECHUS/tshechu-festival5.jpg" width="60%"></center><br>
		<p class="para">It is believed that everyone must attend a Tshechu and witness the mask dances at least once in their lifetime, in order to receive blessings and wash away their sins, but most make it an annual occasion.</p>

		<br>
		<strong><i>Cham Dances</i></strong>
		<br>
		<p class="para">The highlight of the festival is the sacred Cham dances which are performed by both laity and monks dressed in ornate costumes, with evocative titles like ''Dance of the Lords of Cremation Grounds'', "Dance of the Terrifying Deities", and "Dance of the Noblemen and the Ladies", etc.  </p>
		<br>
		<i>The dances re-enact the events that took place during the life of Padmasambhava, mostly depicting goodness triumphs over evil. The Bhutanese believe, by observing the dances, they're blessed, enlightened and purified as they are so sacred.</i>
		<br>
		<p class="para">The dances are accompanied by folk songs and music (cymbal, drum, flute, yak-horn).</p>
		<br>
		<p class="para">Dancers usually wear wooden masks that represent animals, fearsome deities, and various manifestations of Guru Rinpoche. According to legends, Guru Rinpoche has eight manifestations, each with a different name and appearance. The most distinctive mask represents the wrathful manifestation of Guru Rinpoche which he transformed to tame harmful deities.</p>

		<strong><i>Atsaras (Clowns)</i></strong>
		<br>
		<p class="para">They are hidden in red wooden masks with a hawkish nose, a permanent naughty grin and a big phallus on top, they can be witty, eccentric and even bothersome, but without them, a Tshechu would be too tame. They are called ''Atsaras'', clown figures who explain the meaning of mask dances to spectators, who joke around the crowd and liven up the festival with their witty behaviors and exaggerated movements. </p>
		<br>
		<p class="para">But the Atsaras are more than just clowns. The term Atsara is derived from the Sanskrit word Acharya (holy teacher of India) and is called Dubthop in Bhutanese (Dzongkha). One explanation for their burlesque appearances is that, they're reminding us that we could reappear in any possible form in the future.</p>

		<strong><i>The Unfurling of Thangka</i></strong>
		<br>
		<p class="para">The final act of any Tshechu festival is the unfurling of a huge Thongdrol/ thangka (scroll painting) down the side of a Dzong. It takes place in the early hours of the morning! Devotees from corners of Bhutan come together to receive blessings from the world's largest Thongdrol, which depicts Guru Rinpoche, his various manifestations, consorts and religious masters. For many, to witness the unfurling of Thangka is to accumulate merits and receiving blessings.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="para">For Bhutanese, attending this religious festival is an important part of the spiritual devotion for Buddhism. They will wear their finest clothes to attend it. They believe, through festival attendance one can accumulate spiritual merits and move forward to enlightenment, the ultimate goal of Buddhists.</p>
