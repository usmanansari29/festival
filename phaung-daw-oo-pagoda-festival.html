			PHAUNG DAW OO PAGODA FESTIVAL
			</h1>
			<p class="para">
			As a famous attraction of Inle Lake travel and located in the Inle Lake region of Shan State, the Phaung Daw Oo pagoda (or Phaung Daw U) is considered the most famous pagoda in the region and houses five unique Buddha images. The Buddha images have been covered with so many gold leaves in order to safe their original structure.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Like many places in the region, such as Bhutan (see our Bhutan festivals tour), festivals can be the most fascinating time to visit. The is very true for the annual Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda's Festival on Inle Lake which is the country's largest. Celebrated over nearly three weeks each October, it is attended by diversity of hilltribes from throughout the region—from the plains, mountains, and from small remote villages— everybody is here to gain merit and enjoy the festivities.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Like most of life on Inle Lake, the festival is a water bound one. From one of the most famous shrines in Myanmar, Paung Daw U Pagoda at Inle Lake, five small sacred Buddha images are once a year are ceremonially rowed around the Lake in a colorful barge accompanied by many other boats with Inle leg rowers. Although there are five Buddha images at the pagoda, only four Buddha Images are carried on royal barge and conveyed around 14 villages on the Lake. (This is because once, the barge tipped over and the fifth image was nearly lost and only later, somehow, mysteriously appeared back at the pagoda).
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			The sight of the four sacred Buddha images being rowed around the lake on a shimmering gilded barge towed by hundreds of leg-rowers in long canoes against the backdrop of Inle's stunning landscapes is unforgettable. During the festival, each village greets the four images with vivid fanfare, celebrating every moment of the one-night stopover of the barge. Shan dances and martial arts in each special ceremonial boat. Rowing competitions are the highlight of the festival with teams representing various villages around the lake use their skills and strength to win races which we can witness up close from our boat.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			The annual Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda Festival in October is held from the first day of the waxing moon to the 3rd day after the full moon of Thadingyut (the 7th month of the traditional Burmese calendar), falling each year in September and October. Below is a schedule of the festivals for this year, by date, time and activity (though sometimes subject to change, we'll make sure you don't miss anything).

			800 Year-old Golden Images in Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda

			<br>
			<p class="para">
			At the center is an ornate shrine with a pedestal, on which the five more than 800 years old images of the Buddha are kept.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			So much gold leaf has been applied to the images, that they have become unrecognizable as Buddha images and look like a solid mass of gold. Every day Buddhist devotees come to the monastery to pay their respect to the images and apply more gold leaf, which only men are allowed to do.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			The images are believed to have been brought to the Inle Lake region by Alaungsithu, King of the Bagan empire in the 12th century. The King was a devout Buddhist, who travelled extensively around his empire and had many Buddhist monuments built across his Kingdom, the most impressive one being the Thatbyinnyu temple in Bagan.

			<h3>
			Procession of boats carrying the Buddha images
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			In a procession of boats four of the five images of the Buddha are removed from their shrine in the Phaung Daw Oo pagoda and placed on the Royal Karaweik barge. The barge is towed by long boats manned by up to a hundred leg rowers in colorful costumes. The Royal barge stops at 14 villages around Inle lake, where the images stay in the main monastery for one night.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			Lost image miraculously reappeared
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Until the mid 1960’s all five images of the Buddha were carried around the lake on the Karaweik barge. In 1965 one of the images got lost when the boat carrying them capsized and the images fell into the lake. People dived into the water and managed to recover four of them, but the 5th remained lost.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Finally they gave up their search and returned to the Phaung Daw Oo pagoda. Back in the pagoda, they found the lost image miraculously back in its shrine. Since then, only four of the images are carried around the lake, the 5th one remaining in the pagoda.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			Long boat races
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Another highlight of the festival are the long boat races, the rowers standing upright and rowing with an oar attached to one leg.
