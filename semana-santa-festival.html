			The history of Semana Santa	(Easter)

		<p class="para">
		Easter in Spain is one of the most breathtaking celebrations on the planet. Although Easter is celebrated throughout the entire country of Spain, nowhere else are the celebrations more extravagant than in Málaga city. Andalusia is well known around the world for its Easter celebrations. Most if not all of Málaga’s hotels are pre-booked up to 5 years, meaning you have to wait a long time for a place to stay; that is if you plan on visiting this culturally diverse city at Easter.	
		</p>
		<p class="para">
		What is it about Easter in Málaga that gets people so excited? After all, isn’t it just a religious holiday? Well, yes and no. Yes, of course, Easter is a major religious holiday for Catholics worldwide; Easter if you don’t know, pays homage to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and celebrates his resurrection. However, the celebrations in the south of Spain garner the attention of everyone no matter their creed.	
		</p>
		<p class="para">
		But unlike other European Christian countries, where chocolate Easter bunnies are exchanged or the arrival of the sticky sweet mini crème eggs are hotly anticipated; Easter in Málaga believe or not dates back many centuries. The ‘Passion of the Christ’ started in the 16th century; the Catholics were desperate for a way to follow Jesus’ path. Semana Santa as you can well imagine started small, with no more than a few men carrying crosses. Fast-forward to today the men ‘penitents’ prepare for months to the lavish and extremely heavy floats	
		</p>
		<p class="para">
		Semana Santa means Holy Week, and on the Costa del Sol, which includes Málaga, Marbella, San Pedro and several other towns and villages; Easter can only be described as a one-of-a-kind display of tradition. As previously stated, even though Semana Santa takes place across the country, the best places to visit during Holy Week are Málaga, Marbella and Seville.

				<img src="images/semana-santa/semana-santa-festival2.jpg" width="60%">

			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Just like Málaga, Marbella puts on an extremely impression procession. Holy Week in Marbella is of course incredibly important for most people in Andalusia. It is a form of religious expression, and surpasses all other events on the Catholic calendar – even Christmas. Marbella’s cultural activities might seem far reaching considering the cosmopolitan context of this famous city; however Santa Semana’s centuries old traditions do in fact shine through.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Holy Week is dedicated to the Passion of the Christ, where brotherhoods act out his last days before Christ’s death and resurrection. In Marbella there are nine brotherhoods of the passion, which includes those of Nueva Andalusia and San Pedro de Alcantara. It is these brotherhoods that are tasked with the procession of “Our Father Jesus of Mercy”; which is Christ’s entry into Jerusalem beginning on Palm Sunday. These incredible and awe inspiring processions continue throughout the week, a pilgrimage worthy of notoriety.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			In all honesty, Semana Santa needs to be experienced in person, and whether you choose Málaga or Marbella, you won’t be disappointed.

			Semana Santa in Spain: Interesting facts and information
			</h1>
			<li>
			Holy Week or La Semana Santa in Spanish is a seven day celebration starting on a Sunday. The first day is Palm Sunday or el Domingo de Ramos in Spanish
			</li>
			<li>
			The word “ramos” means bouquets or branches
			</li>
			<li>
			Starting on el Domingo de Ramos, Spanish towns across the Costa del Sol have street parades every day
			</li>
			<li>
			In the processions, like in Málaga; people carry and follow floats known as “pasos”. The floats can weigh up to a tonne.
			</li>
			<li>
			Heavy floats are carried by men called costaleros. The costaleros practice for months so the rhythm and speed of how they walk are perfectly coordinated. The men must carry the weight of the float on their shoulders and neck.
			</li>
			<li>
			On these floats are statues of Jesus Christ, and the Virgen Mary or La Virgen Maria in Spanish. Each float is beautifully decorated with flowers, gold, silver, candles and fine fabrics.
			</li>
			<li>
			The floats are followed and surrounded by people known as nazarenos. The nazarenos are men, women and children wearing long robes.
			</li>
			<li>
			The veils or cone shaped hat’s are known as un capirote.
			</li>
			<li>
			The nazarenos keep their faces covered to remain equal and anonymous; helping them stay humble during prayer.
			</li>
			<p class="para">
			Quite often during the processions you will hear someone singing a special song called una saeta. These songs are sung without any musical instruments and often come from above on the balconies. The song is often somber or sorrowful, but beautiful; the singer’s voice seems to carry for a very long distance, and people far away from the procession can hear.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			On Good Friday or el Viernes Santo, meat is not eaten. Most dishes on that day will contain fish and vegetables.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Another popular tasty treat during Holy Week is torrijas. These are thick slices of bread, soaked in milk and beaten egg. They are fried in olive oil and served with sugar or honey.

			Semana Santa History
			</h1>
			<center>
				<img src="images/semana-santa/semana-santa-festival3.jpg" width="60%">
			</center>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Easter in Majorca is a customary religious celebration. In Spanish, Easter week is called Semana Santa. The liturgical events begin on Palm Sunday, along with the ‘Procession of the Entrance of Jesus Christ in Jerusalem’ and the blessing of the Palms or Olive-Tree branches.

			The famous Association of Brotherhoods of Easter organises an exclusive cultural program for Palma de Majorca every year. This program includes the exposition of the standards of each brotherhood in the Church of “Sant Antoniet”.

			Throughout the week, the villagers and visitors will be able to attend concerts in the churches of the city. The religious celebration culminates on the Friday night with the “Pregón” in the famous Church of “Sant Francesc”.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			History of the Good Thursday in Palma Procession
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Initially, the procession promoted by the Brotherhood of the Blood (“Hermandad de la Sang”) was for collecting money for the benefit of the General Hospital. During the 16th century the different working unions were added, with white clothes, pointed hoods and lamps (lanterns). With the new additions, images of Christ and passages with scenes of his ‘Passion’ were carried. These Processions left the Church of the Blood (“La Sang”) and crossed several streets, through the oratories of the nuns monasteries.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			During the 18th century some customs were changed. The color of the clothes was changed to black, the face of the penitents had to be mandatorily covered using the “Caperucha” or “Capirote”. It also became illegal to present single women with presents during the procession or sell sweets on the streets.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			As of 1836, due to the suppression of the unions their involvement in the processions decayed. The processions became an exclusively clerical element, in which only the parochial clergy and associations could take part. From 1841 to 1843, the processions were prohibited, but returned in 1844. In 1847 the attendance of non-clerical penitents began and the participation increased throughout the following 20 years.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			In 1867 there were important new features added. New images were ordered from recognised painters and sculptors: Lluis Font (Jesus in the Orchard and Jesus Carrying the Cross), Salvador Torres (Whipped Jesus) and Gabriel Juan Marroig (Ecce Homo). In addition there were standards with paintings of Gabriel Reiners, Joan Mestre, Francesc Parietti and Ricardo Anckermann. Between 1868 and 1874 the authorities distanced themselves from the processions and anticlerical groups tried to boycott them. In 1872 and 1873, the year of the proclamation of the Iª Republic, the processions were not performed due to this.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			From the Bourbon Restoration, 1875, the Easter Processions returned more popular than ever and the first “Cofradias” or brotherhoods were created with diverse religious associations founding their own brotherhoods or fraternities of Easter.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			During the 1950s the attendance of the processions and the development of brotherhoods increased. In 1955 there were 24 brotherhoods in Palma, the oldest ones being “La Cruz de Calatrava” (1909), “La Real Cofradía de la Dolorosa” (1909) and “La Santa Faz” (1913).

			When and where Is Semana Santa?
			</h1>
			<center>
				<img src="images/semana-santa/semana-santa-festival4.jpg" width="60%">
			</center>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			The dates of the celebration vary on a yearly basis, given that the feast is not attached to a specific date but rather to a cosmic phenomenon. Linked ever since the Roman emperor Constantine the Great called the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. to the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere, Easter can never be celebrated before March 22 (the day after the vernal equinox) or after April 25. Therefore, you can roughly plan on early spring to see Spain's famous processions, but you should check your calendar before making any definite plans.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Cities, towns, and villages across all of Spain come to life during Semana Santa. While each city has its own unique Holy Week celebrations, tag sunny Seville as your main destination for an experience that will leave you absolutely speechless.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			Semana Santa Traditions
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			The holiday, jubilant in Seville and Andalucía and solemn elsewhere in Spain, is practically defined by its stunning processions. Each of these processions typically boasts two intensely adorned floats, one of the Virgin and the other of a scene from Christ's Passion. Take in the lavish decoration of these incredible creations as they slowly pass before you accompanied by the music of coronets and drums; its hard to do without getting chills. Underneath each float, you'll just barely be able to make out rows and rows of feet. There are up to forty men, called costaleros, who haul the float on shoulders and control its swaying motion. In fact, they practice so much and are so in sync with each other that the realistic figures on top look eerily as if they were walking along to the music.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Impossible to miss are the seemingly endless rows of nazarenos, or penitents, who walk along with the float.. You may even see many nazarenos walking barefoot, which is pretty impressive, considering some of the processions last up to 14 hours! Oh, and don't be thrown off by the resemblance between the pointy hoods and long robes of the nazarenos and those of the Ku Klux Klan: it's coincidental and completely unrelated.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Don't be surprised to see how nicely the people dress to watch the processions, especially during the second half of the week. Women often dress to the nines while many men brave the sun in full suits. Of course not everybody dresses up so much, but, basically, if you want to fit in watching the processions, just leave the t-shirt you wore to paint your garage behind.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			Where did the Semana Santa traditions come from?
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Semana Santa as it’s celebrated today was born in the 16th century. It was the idea of the Catholic Church, as a way of explaining the story of the Passion of Christ to non-religious folk.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Throughout the week, parts of the story of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are told through different processions.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			In case you’re still a bit concerned, rest assured that the KKK didn’t take their inspiration from the outfits worn during Holy Week in Spain.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Unfortunately for the faithful in Spain, it’s all just a coincidence. The KKK has no connection to this Roman Catholic tradition. They merely wanted a white costume, to represent skin colour (in Spain the robes are worn in many different colours), that would make them look ghost-like and cover their faces, so no one would know who the perpetrators were.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			No one is entirely sure why Spanish participants in Holy Week wear pointed hats, but faces are covered to represent mourning for the death of Jesus. They’re taken off on Easter Sunday to celebrate the resurrection.
			</p>

			<h3>
			What happens during Semana Santa?
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Semana Santa is a week-long celebration that takes place in cities all over Spain – particularly in Andalucia. During the festival, thousands of people take part in processions as massive floats carrying religious statues are brought to the church. They are also accompanied by marching bands playing religious music with crowds lining the streets to witness it all.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Of all Spain’s many and varied festivals, Semana Santa is the most sombre but also one of the most captivating. The festival pays homage to Jesus Christ’s last days before he was crucified. Many floats feature an effigy of him either carrying a crucifix or already on it. The Virgin Mary is also a prominent effigy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			Semana Santa is still a celebration
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Semana Santa may not be as raucous as other Spanish festivals, but it’s still celebratory. With so many people (both locals and tourists) gathering for it, how can it not be! So you can expect to find bars, cafes and restaurants often crowded with people to celebrate in between and after processions. It’s also worth noting that many businesses and some restaurants are closed during Easter weekend.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>
			Food…
			</h3>
			<center>
				<img src="images/semana-santa/semana-senta-festival6.jpg" width="60%">
			</center>
			<br>
			<p class="para">
			Whilst you can increasingly find chocolate Easter eggs, bunnies and even chickens in Spain, they aren’t traditionally a big feature of the holiday. But it does have a host of dishes typical for Easter. Bear in mind that in the Christian calendar, Easter takes place after Lent, which tends to be a period of abstinence. So Easter marks the end of that and common foods you’ll find include sweet, fried pastries like Buñuelos (doughnuts) and Torrijos (similar to French toast). City Life Madrid has a good guide to Easter dishes popular in Spain.
